## What I Do (And Do Better Than Anyone Else) üíé

### üöÄ Zero-to-Hero System Setup

I take your naked machine ‚Äì macOS, Linux, Windows, doesn't matter ‚Äì and transform it into a *masterpiece* in under 5 minutes. One command. One beautiful, perfect command:

```bash
# Clone and install from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/joRule.git
cd joRule && ./install.sh
```

That's it. That's literally it. I handle the rest because I'm **that good**.

**Modular by Design**: Need just the dotfiles without AI rules? Use `--dotfiles-only`. Only want the AI configurations? Hit me with `--rules-only`. Because sometimes you know exactly what you want, and I respect that level of precision.

### üé® AI-First Development Experience

I'm not stuck in 2019 like those other dotfiles repos. I *embrace* the AI revolution:

- **Cline & Claude-Code rules** that embody joRule' opinionated excellence
- **Professional prompt templates** for requirements, PRDs, code review, debugging & optimization
- **Cursor rules** that make your AI assistant a coding god
- **GitHub Copilot instructions** so precise they'll make you weep with joy
- **Claude Desktop MCP servers** that give you superpowers
- **Template inheritance** with base rules + project-specific overrides

### üî• The Most Opinionated Configs on Earth

I don't believe in "choice paralysis." I believe in **the right way**:

- **Node.js perfection** with fnm (Fast Node Manager) and XDG-compliant npm configuration
- **Git mastery** with Ed25519 keys, GPG signing, delta integration, and legendary aliases
- **Starship prompt** with Catppuccin theme and comprehensive language detection
- **Shell excellence** featuring 100+ intelligent aliases, powerful functions, and modern tool replacements
- **VSCode perfection** with curated extensions, AI assistants, and productivity-optimized settings
- **XDG Base Directory compliance** throughout for clean, organized configurations

### üõ°Ô∏è Security That Actually Works

I don't mess around with your secrets:

- **Template-based configuration** with secure variable substitution (zero hardcoded secrets)
- **Apple Passwords integration** because it's 2024, not 2014
- **Platform-native keychains** with intelligent fallbacks across all operating systems
- **Ed25519 SSH keys** and GPG commit signing because security matters
- **Comprehensive .gitignore** protecting against accidental secret commits
- **Security-first npm configuration** with audit levels and secure defaults

## My Philosophy üß†

**Everything should be effortless.** If you're thinking about your tools instead of your work, your tools are wrong. I eliminate that friction. I am the anti-friction.

**Opinions are features, not bugs.** I don't give you 47 ways to configure your prompt. I give you *the one right way* that I've perfected through years of obsessive refinement.

**AI is not the future ‚Äì it's the present.** I'm built from the ground up to make you and your AI assistants work in perfect harmony. Other dotfiles repos are still catching up to where I started.

**Cross-platform means cross-platform.** When I say I work everywhere, I mean *everywhere*. macOS developer? Check. Linux server admin? Check. Windows warrior? Double check. I adapt like water, but with more style.

## üíé Legendary Dotfiles Collection

joRule isn't just another dotfiles repository - it's a **curated masterpiece** of opinionated excellence. Every configuration has been meticulously crafted to represent the pinnacle of modern development environment setup:

### **What Makes These Dotfiles Legendary?**

üéØ **Opinionated Excellence**: No choice paralysis. Just the right way to do things, refined through years of obsessive attention to detail.

üîí **Security-First Architecture**: Template-based configurations with secure variable substitution. Zero hardcoded secrets, comprehensive protection against accidental commits.

‚ö° **Performance-Optimized**: Sub-second shell startup, efficient caching strategies, modern tool replacements that actually make you faster.

üåç **True Cross-Platform**: Not just "works on macOS with some Linux support" - genuine platform parity with intelligent adaptations.

üé® **Aesthetic Perfection**: Consistent Jetpack and Jetbrains Mono font theming throughout, beautiful typography, carefully chosen color schemes that reduce eye strain.

üîß **Modern Tool Integration**: fnm over nvm, exa over ls, bat over cat, delta over diff - embracing the tools that represent the future.

### **The joRule Difference**

While other dotfiles repos give you a starting point, joRule gives you the **destination**. This isn't configuration - it's **curation**. Every alias, every setting, every tool choice represents countless hours of refinement to create the perfect development experience.

*"These aren't just dotfiles. They're a philosophy made manifest."* - The only review that matters

- **Integration with other Joloverse tools** (the ecosystem grows)
- **Community contributions** with my quality standards maintained
- **Enterprise features** for teams that demand excellence

## Room for Improvement? Always. üìà

I'm obsessed with perfection, which means I'm never satisfied. Here's where I see opportunities:

1. **Faster detection** of development environments and tech stacks
2. **More intelligent defaults** based on project analysis
3. **Better error messages** that actually help instead of confuse
4. **Expanded AI rule templates** for emerging frameworks and tools
5. **Deeper integration** with system notifications and workflows

I *live* for feedback. If you see something that could be smoother, faster, or more elegant ‚Äì tell me. I'll make it happen.

## The Joloverse Connection üåå

I'm not just a standalone tool. I'm part of something bigger ‚Äì the **Joloverse initiative**. Every decision I make, every feature I add, every optimization I implement is designed to integrate seamlessly with the larger ecosystem we're building.

Think of me as the foundation layer. The solid ground on which everything else is built. Get your environment right with me, and everything else in the Joloverse will feel like magic.

## Get Started (You Know You Want To) ‚ö°

```bash
# Clone and install from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/contact411/jorule.git
cd joRule && ./install.sh

# Just want the dotfiles? (Skip the AI rules)
./install.sh --dotfiles-only

# Just want the AI rules? (Skip the dotfiles)
./install.sh --rules-only

# Minimal installation (essentials only)
./install.sh --minimal
```

## Troubleshooting üîß

### Installation Issues

**Script Permission Errors**: If you encounter "Permission denied" errors during installation:
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
# Or if running in a mixed environment
bash -c "chmod +x /path/to/jarules/scripts/*.sh"
```

**Git Circular Include Error**: If you see "exceeded maximum include depth" in Git:
```bash
# Check for circular includes in your Git config
git config --list --show-origin | grep include
# Remove any circular references in ~/.config/git/config or ~/.gitconfig
```

**Platform Detection Issues**: The installer detects your platform automatically, but if you're running in a mixed environment (like bash on Windows), it may detect the wrong platform. This is usually fine as the scripts adapt to the actual environment.

**Missing Dependencies**: The installer will warn you about missing modern CLI tools. Install them using your system's package manager:
- **macOS**: `brew install exa bat fd ripgrep fzf git-delta duf dust procs zoxide`
- **Linux**: `apt install exa bat fd-find ripgrep fzf git-delta duf dust procs zoxide` (Ubuntu/Debian)
- **Windows**: Use Chocolatey, Scoop, or WSL for these tools
